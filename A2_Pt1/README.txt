A Star Wars based program that creates child 
processes from parent processes through the 
use of forks and pids.  Each process increases
the base or starting value by a predefined 
value, but doesn't add to the totaled amount
from the most recent calculated total. Values
of increment include 25%, 20%, 30%, and 15%,
which are added to the base percentage of 50%.
